# Material Web React Components

This library provides a set of React components styled with Material Design, leveraging the capabilities of `@material/web` and `@lit/react`.

## Installation

To install Material Web React, you can use npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install react-material-web
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-material-web
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started. After installing, you can import and use Material Components like any other React component.

Add styles to your project:
```tsx
import 'react-material-web/styles'
```

Then, you can use the components like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { MdFilledButton } from 'react-material-web';

function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MdFilledButton>Click me</MdFilledButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```
