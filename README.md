## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started. After installing, you can import and use Material Components like any other React component.

import { Button } from 'material-web-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MdFilledButton>Click me</MdFilledButton>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
